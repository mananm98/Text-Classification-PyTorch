# Text Classification Models for Amazon Reviews Dataset

This repository contains code for training and evaluating various recurrent neural network (RNN) models for text classification on the Amazon Reviews dataset. Specifically, we train and evaluate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models on the dataset. The goal of this project is to explore the performance of different RNN models on a real-world text classification task, and to provide a benchmark for future work on this dataset.

## Dataset
The Amazon Reviews dataset consists of product reviews from Amazon.com, spanning a wide range of product categories. The dataset is preprocessed and split into train, validation, and test sets, with each review labeled as either positive or negative.
